The dataset used is the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, containing features like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and more.
Several ML algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Trees, were implemented for prediction.
The project involves comprehensive data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values and standardization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed important correlations between features influencing diabetes risk.
Feature engineering and model evaluation were performed to improve the predictive accuracy of the models.
The SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 75.1%, followed by other models with slightly lower accuracy.
The project emphasized the potential of ML in improving early diabetes diagnosis and intervention.
Future work involves using more advanced ML models, such as deep learning, and incorporating real-time patient data.
The project offers valuable insights into the use of ML for healthcare and chronic disease prediction.
